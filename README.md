# Boids

That is my implementation of the boids code.

## Compilation

To compile this project, you need [CMake](https://cmake.org), [Boost](http://boost.org), and the [SFML](sfml-dev.org) library.

## TODO

- [x] Add obstacles
- [x] Correct boids behaviour around obstacles
  - [ ] Allow boids to adopt a tear-drop shape around the obstacles
- [ ] Speed up the algorithms
- [ ] Allow adding new rules easily
- [ ] Make the code easier to read
- [ ] Go 3D
